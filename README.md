# 100 Days React Challenge

The 100 Days React Challenge is a project that I created to help me learn React. The idea is to code for at least 1 hour every day for 100 days. I will be working on a project that I have in mind and I will be documenting my progress on this repository.

### Projects

- Day 1 - XOX Game /xox
- Day 2 - Reflex Game /reflex
